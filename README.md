<hr>
<br>
Dancemusic.wtf is a web based quiz game created for us to learn how the different electronic dance music geners sound like. And hopefully we‚Äôll  have a better vocabulary next time we're trying to describe that great track we heard the other night.<br>


#### üóÑÔ∏èDataset

Dancemusic.wtf uses over 500 unique music tracks from 57 different subgenres in Electronic Dance Music. <br>The dataset is based upon [musicmap.info](https://www.musicmap.info/) and its public [YouTube playlists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvwUL1or_EKtt-qmt_ob2KA/playlists). Created by Kwinten Crauwels. 

> Musicmap attempts to provide the ultimate genealogy of popular music genres, including their relations and history. It is the result of more than **seven years of research** with over 200 listed sources and cross examination of many other visual genealogies. Its aim is to focus on the delicate balance between comprehensibility, accuracy and accessibility.


(I really recommend you to check out musicmap.info if you wanna digg deeper, or learn about other genres outside of the electronic dance music cluster. It is a gold mine!)


#### üñ•Ô∏è Support Devices

The web app is tested on `macOS` in `Chrome 68`, `Safari 11`, `Firefox 61` and on `iOS 11.4`.<br>
Let me know if you have problems with any other devices or browsers!
