<h4 align="center">Quiz Game for Learning Electronic Dance Music Genres. How High Can You Score?</h4>


<br>
<br>


## About
Dancemusic.wtf is a web based quiz game created for Me & You to learn how the major dance music geners sound like. <br>And hopefully we‚Äôll  have a better vocabulary next time we're trying to describe that great track we've heard the other night .<br><br>


#### üóÑÔ∏è Dataset

Dancemusic.wtf uses the 6 Main Electronic Dance Music Genres (`Breakbeat`, `Drum 'N' Bass`, `Hardcore`, `Techno`, `House`, `Trance`), and their 57 Subgenres. Resulting in over 500 Individual Tracks.


The dataset is based upon **[musicmap.info](https://www.musicmap.info/)** and its public [youtube playlists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvwUL1or_EKtt-qmt_ob2KA/playlists). Which is the result of more than seven years of research including over 200 listed sources, created by **Kwinten Crauwels**. 


I really recommend you to check out [musicmap.info](https://www.musicmap.info/) if you wanna digg deeper, or learn about other genres outside of the electronic dance music cluster. It is a gold mine! 


#### üñ•Ô∏è Support Devices

The web app is tested on `macOS` in `Chrome 68`, `Safari 11`, `Firefox 61` and on `iOS 11.4`.<br>
Let me know if you find problems with any other devices!
